            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Before going through the steps, it helps to better understand what
              the document you’re filling out is. A check is a promise to pay.
              It works like money in that you’re giving a “note” with all your
              account information and the amount being paid to a recipient that
              they can then take to a bank to deposit or cash.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Most checks have six required sections:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-8">
              <li>Date</li>
              <li>Payee line (who is receiving money)</li>
              <li>Amount in numbers (amount being paid, like $450.00)</li>
              <li>
                Amount in words (amount being paid, like “four hundred fifty
                dollars and zero cents”)
              </li>
              <li>Memo line (what the payment is for)</li>
              <li>Signature (your authorization to release the funds)</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              The more you correctly fill out the check, the easier it will be
              to remember how to write in each space correctly. Let’s get into
              the details of how to write a check with cents, dollars, hundreds,
              and more.
            </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                A date on a check will be in the upper right-hand corner. You
                want to use the current date you are writing the check in a
                standard format like 08/03/2025 or “August 3, 2025.” The date
                must include the day of the month, month of the year, and year.
              </p>

                <p className="text-red-800">
                  Never postdate or backdate checks unless absolutely necessary.
                  That would mean filling in a date that was in the past or the
                  future. That can cause confusion and lead to mistakes if you
                  don’t account for the funds and incur overdraft fees.
                </p>
              </div>

                checks will say “only good for 90 days” or similar guidelines.

              </h3>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                There is a line on the check that usually has “pay to the order
                of” underneath. That is where you are to write the “payee” or
                “recipient” of the money. If you’re writing a check for a cat
                adoption organization, you would write “Happy Paws, LLC” in that
                space.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The trick is to ensure the payee fits the “legal” name of the
                entity. For individuals, you want to use the legal name used on
                their government-issued ID. For businesses, write out the whole
                business or who the company is “doing business as,” which they
                can clarify.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In those cases when you want to write a check to yourself to
                cash out, you can use your own name or pay to the order of
                “CASH.” Always take the time to double-check spelling before
                moving to the next step.

              </h3>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                A crucial step in how to write out a check is entering the
                amount. In the middle of the check will be a long line. To the
                right of that is a box. That is where you write the amount of
                the check in numbers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                If you’re paying someone $1,500 for a used set of car tires, you
                would write “$1,500.00” in that space. Be sure your decimal
                point is in the correct space and you’re using commas for any
                amount of thousands or more.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Never leave space next to the amount where someone can write in
                additional numbers. You want to avoid any tampering that may
                result in additional fees on your bank accounts.
              </p>
            </div>

              </h3>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Checks are designed for redundancy. The bank wants to be sure
                you’re issuing the correct amount of money to reduce potential
                errors. You need to spell out the amount of the check in that
                long line to the left of the small box you just used.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In our example, we write “$1,500.00” for a payment. On this
                line, we will write out “One thousand five hundred dollars and
                zero cents.” You capitalize only the first letter and draw a
                solid line through any remaining space so no one can write out
                additional numbers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Be sure your spelled-out amount matches your numerical amount
                before you hand over the check. You can also use a fraction for
                cents if you’d like. So, in our example, there are no cents, but
                we could write 0/100 instead of “and zero cents” at the end.
              </p>

              </h3>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                While the memo line is optional, it is a good idea for tracking
                your spending to fill it out. How to fill out a check has more
                to do with hitting the details than leaving spaces blank.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In the bottom left-hand corner is a memo space where you would
                put what the money is for, like “August Rent,” “party supplies,”
                or “medical bill-Acct 2284.” Some vendors require a memo for
                their own tracking, so it never hurts to ask before issuing
                payment.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The final step in learning how to write a check is your
                authorized signature in the bottom right-hand corner. This
                should be in cursive and represent that you agree to release the
                designated funds to the identified recipient.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                You must use blue or black ink (no red) and sign your full legal
                name that matches your government-issued ID or name on the bank
                account the money is coming from.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Never leave a check without a signature. Never sign a check
                without all the information filled out. Either way, you will
                flag the bank that the check isn’t valid.

                How to fill out a check takes practice and attention to detail.
                Take your time in the beginning so you know every space is
                correctly filled out. Otherwise, you could run into several
                common mistakes that could lead to bounced checks, invalidated
                payments, or bank fees. Those include:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-8">
                <li>
                  Leaving Blank Spaces: Banks will not cash a check with blank
                  fields (except the memo space). Every section has to be filled
                  out to be authorized for payment or deposit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Incorrect Numbers: If the amount you wrote in numbers does not
                  match the amount you spelled out in words, the check is not
                  valid and should be ripped up after writing “VOID” across the
                  middle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wrong Payee: Always be sure the person or business you’re
                  writing the check to has the correct name. This happens a lot
                  with people who changed their maiden name to a married name or
                  a company going through a transition. The name has to match.
